          TI soon learned to know this flower better.  <br> On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple.  <br> They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away.  <br> But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet.  <br> It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.
